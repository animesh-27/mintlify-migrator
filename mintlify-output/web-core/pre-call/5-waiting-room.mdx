title: "Waiting Room"
---

After you call `.join()` on meeting, you either get a `roomJoined` event if you are allowed to join or a `waitlisted` event.

Use the `self.roomState` to track the user's state in the meeting.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    init --> joined
    init --> waitlisted
    waitlisted --> joined
    waitlisted --> rejected
```

<br />

This diagram only represents the waiting room related states, the `roomState` property also transitions through other states

Each of these state changes generate their own events.
