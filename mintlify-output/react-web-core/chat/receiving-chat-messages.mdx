title: "Receiving chat messages"
---

The `meeting.chat` object emits events when new chat messages are received. You
can listen for the `chatUpdate` event to log when a new chat message is
received.

```ts
const messages = useDyteSelector((m) => m.chat.messages));
```

Here, the `message` is of type `Message`, as defined in
[introduction](./introduction). `messages` is a list of all chat messages in the
meeting, which is the same as `meeting.chat.messages`.

When a chat message is received, the `meeting.chat.messages` list is also
updated.

```ts
console.log(JSON.stringify(meeting.chat.messages));
meeting.chat.on('chatUpdate', () => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(meeting.chat.messages));
});
```
